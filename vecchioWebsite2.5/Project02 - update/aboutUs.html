    <h1>Get to know us better</h1>

    <p>We've been in the industry of tours since 2024, Ever since then it has been our passion to show people the best trails, the most scenic views,
      and overall show people the best experience that nature can provide!
    </p>

    <h2>Why Nature Guides?</h2>
    <p>With technology becoming more and more integrated into society, it's harder to be able to experience the great outdoors. On top of that, kids growing up
      in this time also will not get to experience nature but that's where we come in. We are able to not only show kids all the best trails and views in the area,
      but also teach them safety tips like what plants to not touch, or how to interact with wildlife. These guides, however, are not just for kids. These are meant
      for the whole family to enjoy!
